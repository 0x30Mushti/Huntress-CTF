## Description
```
Wow! This is a big QR code! I wonder what it says...?
```

**Steps to solve the CTF:**

Download the QR-code.png-file.

To Scan the qr-code and read it I used "https://qrscanner.net/"

See the output in the file called "qrcode_output.txt"

I seems like the hexstring is pointing to a new png photo. Lets write a short script which can be found in "topng".

Great, now its time to scan the QR-code again.
