# Technical Support

## Description
```
Want to join the party of GIFs, memes and emoji shenanigans? Or just want to ask a question for technical support regarding any challenges in the CTF?
This CTF uses support tickets to help handle requests. If you need assistance, please create a ticket with the #ctf-open-ticket channel. 
You do not need to direct message any CTF organizers or facilitators, they will just tell you to open a ticket. You might find a flag in the ticket channel, though!
```

## How to solve the CTF:

This is pretty straight forward. 

Join Huntress Discord.

Head over to "#ctf-open-ticket channel".

The flag will be there in plain text.
