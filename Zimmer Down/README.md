# Zimmer Down

## Description


```
A user interacted with a suspicious file on one of our hosts.
The only thing we managed to grab was the user's registry hive.
Are they hiding any secrets?

```

## Managed to get first blood on this chall ðŸ©¸

## How to solve the CTF and info:

First, let's read the description carefully and highlight some important keywords: "interacted" and "file".


When it comes to Registry forensics I always use [Registy Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)

Load the file the **Ntuser.dat** file in to registry explorer. 

When investigating recently interacted or accessed files, we focus on the subkey **RecentDocs**.


## What is the RecentDocs Key?

The RecentDocs registry key in the NTUSER.DAT file tracks recently accessed documents for a user. This key helps Windows quickly display recently opened files in applications like File Explorer. While it's handy for user experience and troubleshooting, we use it here strictly for forensic analysis. ðŸ˜‰

 The RecentDocs key is typically found in the following location within a userâ€™s NTUSER.DAT hive:
```
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs
```

Under the RecentDocs subkey, there are additional subkeys grouped by file extensions, such as: ```.PNG```,```.JPEG```,```.DOC```



## Contunuing the CTF:

Now to put my skills to the test! I navigate to::

```
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs
```

I notice a subkey called **.b62**, which is an unfamiliar extension to me. However, it immediately reminds me of Base62 encoding. 

Under the **Target Name** field, I find the following file:

```
Target Name
VJGSuERgCoVhl6mJg1x87faFOPIqacI3Eby4oP5MyBYKQy5paDF.b62
```

I copy the file name and paste it into CyberChef, selecting the Base62 decoding option.

The flag should appear after decoding!
